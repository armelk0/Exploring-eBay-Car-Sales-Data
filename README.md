# Exploring-eBay-Car-Sales-Data

This project will show our skills in using Pandas and Numpy to explore, clean and prepare data for analysis.
In this project, we are going to work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen , a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. However DataQuest has made a few modifications to the dataset by:

Sampling 50,000 data points from the full dataset, to ensure the code runs quickly in their hosted environment.
Dirtying the dataset a bit more to closely resemble what we would expect from a scraped dataset (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with).

In this project, we are going to clean and analyze the included used car listings.
